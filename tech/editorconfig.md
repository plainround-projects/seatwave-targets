# EditorConfig

## What it is

Different editors default to different rules: tabs or spaces, Windows or Unix line endings, trimming spaces at the end of a line or not. **EditorConfig** is a small file format, named `.editorconfig`, that a project places at its root so that every editor applies the same basic rules. Most editors read it by themselves or through a plug-in. It is a **hint to editors**, not a checker: nothing fails if a file breaks a rule.

## Why this repository uses it

So that every contributor's editor writes files the same way: UTF-8 text, Unix line endings, spaces, a final newline. That keeps Git diffs free of noise and prevents a Windows editor from adding carriage returns to `gradlew`.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `.editorconfig` | The rules, 14 lines. |
| `.gitattributes` | Enforces line endings at the Git level, where EditorConfig cannot (`git.md`). |
| `build.gradle.kts` and other files | The files the rules apply to. |

## How it works underneath

1. When you open or save a file, the editor looks for `.editorconfig` in the file's folder, then in each parent folder, until it finds one that says `root = true`.
2. It reads the sections, which are headed by a **glob** (a pattern for file names) in square brackets. `*` matches any file name, `*.md` matches names that end in `.md`, `{a,b}` matches either `a` or `b`.
3. Every section whose pattern matches the file applies, and later sections override earlier ones.
4. Each line is `property = value`. The editor applies the properties it understands.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

```text
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
indent_style = space

[*.{java,toml,yaml,yml}]
indent_size = 2

[*.kts]
indent_size = 4

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

- `root = true` stops the editor from looking in parent folders for more `.editorconfig` files. It sits before any section.
- `[*]` starts the section for every file.
- `charset = utf-8` saves files as UTF-8, the encoding that can represent every character and that the compiler is told to expect (`options.encoding = "UTF-8"`, `gradle.md`).
- `end_of_line = lf` ends lines with a line feed, the Unix convention (`\n`). The Windows script `gradlew.bat` is the exception, and `.gitattributes` covers it (`git.md`).
- `insert_final_newline = true` makes the last line of a file end with a line break.
- `trim_trailing_whitespace = true` deletes spaces at the end of lines when saving.
- `indent_style = space` indents with spaces, never tab characters.
- `[*.{java,toml,yaml,yml}]` starts a section for files with those four extensions.
- `indent_size = 2` makes one indentation level two spaces. This matches the google-java-format style (`spotless-google-java-format.md`).
- `[*.kts]` starts a section for the Gradle build files, which are written in Kotlin.
- `indent_size = 4` makes one indentation level four spaces there, the usual Kotlin style and what both build files use.
- `[*.md]` starts a section for Markdown files.
- `trim_trailing_whitespace = false` overrides the `[*]` rule for Markdown. In Markdown, two spaces at the end of a line can mean "hard line break", so trimming would change the meaning.

### What I found when comparing the rules with the files

- `build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts` are indented with four spaces (`grep -c "^    " build.gradle.kts` prints 49), which matches the `[*.kts]` section. EditorConfig does not fail the build, and Spotless does not format Kotlin files here, so this rule is kept by editors and by care, not by a check.
- No file in the repository has trailing spaces in the files I checked (`build.gradle.kts` and `compose.yaml` each give 0), and `build.gradle.kts` ends with a newline.

## Try it yourself

1. Show the rules with line numbers:

```
cat -n .editorconfig
```

   Expected: the 14 lines quoted above.

2. Find trailing spaces in two files:

```
grep -c ' $' build.gradle.kts compose.yaml
```

   Expected: `build.gradle.kts:0` and `compose.yaml:0`.

3. Check that a file ends with a newline:

```
tail -c1 build.gradle.kts | od -c | head -1
```

   Expected: `0000000   \n`.

4. Count four-space indented lines in the Kotlin files:

```
grep -c "^    " build.gradle.kts settings.gradle.kts
```

   Expected: `build.gradle.kts:49` and `settings.gradle.kts:4`, which matches the four-space rule for `.kts` files.

## Mistakes people make

- **Thinking EditorConfig enforces anything.** It only guides editors. Spotless and Git attributes enforce.
- **Missing the `root = true` line.** The editor may pick up rules from a parent folder.
- **Trimming whitespace in Markdown.** That is why `[*.md]` turns it off.
- **Expecting an old editor to read the file.** Some editors need a plug-in.
- **Rules that disagree with the formatter.** Here `indent_size = 2` for Java matches google-java-format on purpose.

## Check yourself

1. *What does `root = true` mean?* Stop searching parent folders for more `.editorconfig` files.
2. *Why does `[*.md]` turn off `trim_trailing_whitespace`?* Two trailing spaces mean a line break in Markdown.
3. *Which files get a two-space indent?* `.java`, `.kts`, `.toml`, `.yaml` and `.yml`.
4. *Does EditorConfig fail the build?* No. It is a hint to editors.
5. *Which file sets line endings for `gradlew.bat`?* `.gitattributes`, with `*.bat text eol=crlf`.
