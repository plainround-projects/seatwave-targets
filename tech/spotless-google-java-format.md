# Spotless 8.11.0 and google-java-format 2.0.0

## What it is

A **formatter** rewrites source code into one fixed layout: where the spaces go, where lines break, how imports are ordered. It changes no behavior. **google-java-format** is a formatter for Java with one fixed style and almost no options. **Spotless** is a Gradle plugin that runs formatters over the files of a project. It can only check ("does any file differ from the formatted version?") or apply ("rewrite them").

Two tools, two jobs: Spotless is the Gradle plugin in version 8.11.0. google-java-format is the formatter it runs, in version 2.0.0, downloaded as a library when needed.

## Why this repository uses it

With one enforced layout nobody argues about style, reviews show only real changes, and nobody formats by hand. The README says: "One enforced code style, so nobody formats by hand." Because `spotlessCheck` is part of `check`, an unformatted file stops the gate.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does with Spotless |
| --- | --- |
| `build.gradle.kts` | Switches the plugin on (`alias(libs.plugins.spotless)`) and configures it (`spotless { java { ... } }`). |
| `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | Holds the two versions: `spotless = "8.11.0"` and `googleJavaFormat = "2.0.0"`. |
| `src/main/java/**`, `src/test/java/**` | The files it checks (every Java source file of the project). |
| `.editorconfig` | Declares two-space indentation for Java, the same as the formatter (`editorconfig.md`). |

## How it works underneath

1. `./gradlew spotlessCheck` runs the task `spotlessJava`, which finds the Java source files and feeds each one through the formatter steps in the order they are listed: google-java-format, then removal of unused imports, then the end-of-file rule.
2. The result is compared with the file on disk. If they are identical, the task passes. If not, it fails and prints a **diff** (a list of the lines that would change; in the diff a middle dot stands for a space) and the sentence `Run './gradlew spotlessApply' to fix all violations.`
3. `./gradlew spotlessApply` writes the formatted result back into the files.
4. Spotless remembers what it checked, so unchanged files are skipped. A second run prints `UP-TO-DATE`.

google-java-format's rules, as they show in this repository's code: two spaces of indentation, four spaces for a continued line, a hard limit of 100 columns, one statement per line, braces always, a blank line between methods, and imports sorted in ASCII order with all `import static` lines first. Two lines in `SheetReportTest.java` are longer than 100 columns: they sit in a text block, where the formatter must not change the text.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

```kotlin
spotless {
    java {
        googleJavaFormat(libs.versions.googleJavaFormat.get())
        removeUnusedImports()
        endWithNewline()
    }
}
```

- `spotless { ... }` is the extension block of the plugin.
- `java { ... }` configures the Java formatting target.
- `googleJavaFormat(libs.versions.googleJavaFormat.get())` adds the google-java-format step. The version comes from the catalog (`toml-version-catalog.md`), so changing the formatter means editing one line. The step also pins the style, because the formatter has only one.
- `removeUnusedImports()` deletes `import` lines whose names are never used. Spotless does this with its own step; the formatter alone does not.
- `endWithNewline()` makes sure the last character of each file is a line break.

The plugin itself is switched on in line 4 of the build file with `alias(libs.plugins.spotless)` (`gradle.md`).

### An experiment in a scratch copy

I copied the repository (without `build/`, `.gradle/` and `.git`) to a scratch folder, so the real files stayed untouched. I added one badly formatted method to `Component.java` and ran `./gradlew spotlessCheck`. It failed:

```
> Task :spotlessJavaCheck FAILED
> The following files had format violations:
      src/main/java/io/plainround/seatwave/targets/availability/Component.java
          @@ -25,5 +25,8 @@
          -··static·int···badlyFormatted(·)·{return·1;}
          +
          +··static·int·badlyFormatted()·{
          +····return·1;
          +··}
  Run './gradlew spotlessApply' to fix all violations.
```

Then `./gradlew spotlessApply` rewrote the file, and a second `./gradlew spotlessCheck` passed. The formatter removed the extra spaces, put a blank line before the method and broke the body onto its own lines.

## Try it yourself

1. Check the real repository (it must already be formatted):

```
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

   Expected: `> Task :spotlessJavaCheck` and `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. On a repeat run each task says `UP-TO-DATE`.

2. List the Spotless tasks:

```
./gradlew tasks --all | grep -i spotless
```

   You see `spotlessApply`, `spotlessCheck`, `spotlessJava`, `spotlessJavaApply` and `spotlessJavaCheck`, and also `spotlessDiagnose`, `spotlessJavaDiagnose` and `spotlessInstallGitPrePushHook`.

3. Find lines longer than 100 columns in the Java files:

```
awk 'length>100{print FILENAME": "FNR}' $(git ls-files 'src/*.java')
```

   Expected: two lines, both in `SheetReportTest.java` (lines 50 and 51, the text block).

4. Try the failure yourself, in a copy so the repository stays clean:

```
mkdir /tmp/spotless-demo && rsync -a --exclude build --exclude .gradle --exclude .git --exclude tech ./ /tmp/spotless-demo/ && cd /tmp/spotless-demo
```

   Open any `.java` file there, add a method such as `static int   badlyFormatted( ) {return 1;}` before the last `}`, then run `./gradlew spotlessCheck` (expect `FAILED` and the diff) and `./gradlew spotlessApply` (expect `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` and a tidy file). Delete the folder afterwards.

## Mistakes people make

- **Fixing style by hand.** Run `./gradlew spotlessApply`; it is faster and always right.
- **Committing without running `spotlessApply`.** The next `check` fails.
- **Expecting the formatter to fix everything.** It never renames a variable or deletes dead code. It only changes layout.
- **Formatting the Kotlin build files with it.** This build configures Spotless for Java only; `build.gradle.kts` is not formatted by it.
- **Using different formatter versions on different machines.** The version is pinned in the catalog, so everyone gets 2.0.0.
- **Hand-wrapping long strings.** In a text block the formatter keeps your text as it is.

## Check yourself

1. *What is the difference between `spotlessCheck` and `spotlessApply`?* The first fails if any file would change. The second changes the files.
2. *Which version of the formatter does the build use, and where is it set?* 2.0.0, in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (`googleJavaFormat`).
3. *Why can an unformatted file stop the build?* `check` depends on `spotlessCheck`.
4. *What does `removeUnusedImports()` do?* Deletes `import` lines that nothing uses.
5. *What indentation does the style use?* Two spaces, with four for a continued line.
